# Self-Balancing-Bot

This is an ongoing personal project of a PID control based self balancing robot. It's now on the prototype and gathering knowledge and intelligence phase. <br>
Participation is very much appreciated! (:<br>

This is a PlatformIO project that targets the esp32 development board currently based on the Arduino Framework <br>

## Goals for this project:
  - Get familiar and comfortable using PID algorithms
  - Learn how to integrate data from encoders
  - Sensor fusion
  - Explore the ESP32 dual core functionalities
  - Explore embedded systems architecture
  - Experiment with the mechanics of a self balancing robot

## TODO
- Play with encoders PID
- Fix drift
